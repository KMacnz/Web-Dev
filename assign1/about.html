                <br><h4>What special features have you done or attempted in creating the website? </h4>
                <li>Setting up an asthetically pleasing interface using css</li>

                <br><h4>Which parts did you have trouble with?</h4>
                <li>Getting started with the database, since we haven't yet covered it in class I was left with just google to help me figure it out</li>
                <li>Trying to incorporate html tags in with php code (like div tags) took me a few tries to figure out that "echo" statements are needed for these too</li>
                <li>Whenever an SQL statement is run a "$conn ->query($sql);" is required to execute the query</li>

                <br><h4>What would you like to do better next time?</h4> 
                <li>Changing up my forms, so if they have incorrect data that requires changing it will not clear the whole form on the redirect</li>

                <br><h4>What you have learnt along the way? Did you use any references or resources during this 
                project? If so, please include the sources</h4>
                <li>W3Schools</li>
                <li>Stackoverflow</li>
                <li>PHP Sandbox</li>
                <li>Lecture Slides</li>
                <li>During this project I had to remind myself of certain functions in css that I could use to make my site nicer, Also the while using sql in php as we are yet to have done that in class which is where I used the sandbox. As well as small syntax errors in my code</li>
